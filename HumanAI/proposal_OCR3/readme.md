#### End-to-end handwritten text recognition for early modern spanish documents

Our goal is to build a robust model for optical text recognition tailored to digitized early modern Spanish manuscripts.
We’re leaning on transformer-based or self-supervised architectures, TrOCR or similar, to tackle full-document recognition.
This means not just extracting text, but also considering the document’s structure: layout, reading order, the works.
These manuscripts are tricky—handwritten, faded ink, so we need a system that’s adaptable, and precise.
